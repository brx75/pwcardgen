      <p>
      This is a Password Card Generator. A password card is a business card filled with number and letters that you can use as password. You just have to remember, for each site, where to start in the card grid and in which direction read the cels. This makes the card safe to be kept in your wallet. Read the reference links below for more info about password cards.
      </p>
      <p>
      You can genearate your own Password Card by entering any string (called "key") in the text area. If you lose your card, you can re-generate the same one by entering the same key.
      </p>
      <p>
      This password card is generared by encrypting a common text pad (the sequence of ASCII characters from '!' until '~') using the blowfish algorithm with your own key. The encrypted stream is then base64 encoded, some characters are removed (see 'filter' variable in the code) and the result is then split in groups of characters that are displayed in a grid.  
      </p>
      <p>
      This grid can then be printed, folded and put in your wallet.
