Password Card Geneator
======================

This experimental project generates a Password Card for your use.

The card is password based so if you loose your card, you can re-generate it.
The card is as safe as your master password is.

The basic alghorithm is:
 * generate a text pad (some ascii chars)
 * entrypt the text pad with your master password using blowfish
 * the binary blowfish output is then parsed through an encoding filter
 * this encoding converts each byte to a char and some are filtered out

There are two flavors:
 perl/ - perl script
 js/ - html page that uses javascript and that can be run from a browser
